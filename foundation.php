<div class="single-column">
  <p>Founded in 1974, the UC Santa Cruz Foundation is a public nonprofit corporation that promotes and manages private philanthropy for UC Santa Cruz. Comprised of alumni and non-alumni Trustees from diverse professional, ethnic and geographic backgrounds, the Board partners with UCSC's Chancellor, administration, faculty, staff and students to advance the University's goals and priorities and increase private resources to support the campus.</p>
  <p>As key volunteers and campus liaisons to the donor community, Trustees set an example through their own generous giving and           serve as advisors, advocates, fundraisers and stewards of UCSC's endowments. They help identify potential donors and connect them with the cutting-edge programs and funding opportunities on campus.  As ambassadors, Trustees actively promote UCSC and act as influential advocates on its behalf.</p>
